We welcome contributions of all kinds, whether you’re fixing bugs, suggesting new features, or improving the documentation. This guide will help you get started and outline the best ways to contribute.

 💡 **How to Contribute**

 🐛 **1. Reporting Bugs**
Found a bug? Let us know! 
Open an issue in the repository and include as much information as possible:

- **Steps to reproduce** the issue.
- What **you expected** to happen.
- What **actually happened** (screenshots are helpful).
- Any relevant **error messages** or logs.

You can submit bugs via the [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/sarat1kyan/issues) page. Please check if the bug has already been reported before submitting.

 🧠 **2. Suggesting New Features**
Got an idea to make **Linux-Moonlit** even better? 
I'd love to hear it! Submit a feature request by opening a new issue labeled **"Feature Request"** and include:

- A clear **description** of the feature.
- Why you think it would be **valuable** for users.
- Any **examples** or references that inspired your suggestion.

 🛠️ **3. Submitting Code**
If you're ready to contribute code, follow these steps:

1. **Fork** the repository.
2. Create a new branch:  
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/YourFeatureName
   ```
3. Make your changes or additions.
4. **Test** your changes to ensure they work correctly.
5. Commit your changes:  
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add feature: YourFeatureName"
   ```
6. Push to your fork:  
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/YourFeatureName
   ```
7. Open a **pull request** to the main repository with a description of what you’ve done.

 💡 **Code Guidelines**
- **Follow our style guide**: Make sure your code matches the existing coding style.
- **Write clear commit messages**: Be concise but descriptive (e.g., "Fix issue #42: AI assistant crash on startup").
- **Include comments** where necessary to explain complex logic.

 ✍️ **4. Improving Documentation**
Clear and comprehensive documentation is critical. You can help by:

- Fixing typos or improving the clarity of existing documents.
- Writing new guides, how-tos, or FAQs.
- Updating sections when new features are added.

All documentation files can be found in the `docs/` directory. Submit improvements just like code, through pull requests.

 🧪 **5. Testing**
Contributions aren’t limited to just code or documentation! 
You can help by testing the latest changes, reporting bugs, and providing feedback on new features.

- **Download** the latest pre-release from the [releases](https://github.com/sarat1kyan/releases) page.
